Data Modeling

Step1:
	Users: 
		Internal(80%) 
			who making business (not tech) decision
			Internal employees, team
			e.g. Reporting Appliation for hospital
				-Floor performance(head, manager)
				-provider(doctor,nurse, how offer services)
				-patient feedback
				-appointment scheduling
				-ER availability
		External
			public ursers (out of orgnization)
			e.g.
				Patient portal
				-Schedule appointment
				-visit summary
				-payments
				Website: best buy
	Meeting:		
		Joint Requirment Definition - JRD -->Joint Application Design - JAD

		Alternative Methods:

		Face to Face interviews
		--> Anonymous Qestionaires 
		--> Feedback Surveys or Equivalent
	

	Requirment session: 
				Business Required Document - BRD 
				Users, tech, managers, tech ceads, sr.developers, BA, DA, PM.
				Time: depend on scoup of application
					Small (2 weeks -- 2 months)
					Huge (1 week -- 6 months)
			--> Function Requirment Document -FRD
		Alternative: 
				Stakeholder Analysis
					Find all those involved
				Business Analysis Plan
					Budget, strategy
				Current State Analysis(same as BRD)
					
				Scope Statement Specification
		Business Requirment Document (from BA, word templates,share by share point(SP), Team Foundation Server(TFS), Git)
	Why:
		Track changes
		Share information among all persons
		Finalize and find agreement on requirements
		Prevent changes or legal issues


	How Methodologies:
		Waterfall
		Scrum
		Agile
		Spiral
	Variables to Monitor( How to choice methods):
		Requirments
		Schedule/Time of Year
		Budget
		Size of Project
		Size of Team

	Assenment: Hospital Mnagement, Health Insurance lceares, Auto Insurance
		1. BRD - No more than 2 paragraphs
	
	Research Questions:
		1. What is your style of gethering requirements?
		2. How do you prepare 
		3. What is GAP analysisw

	Documents:
		FRD,SDS, SDD, TDS, TDD
			-Naning convenisions
			-Steps for deployment
			-Permission on a folder/DB/Server
		Data Dictionary
			-Information about database
				-Tables
				-Columns
				-Datatypes
				-Sample
				-Application(Optional)
		Mapping Document
			1.ETL Process(Load data in sperate DB into one large total DB)
			2.Upgrade DB Version (EX. ss2012-->SS2017)
			3.Migrate From different DB System(EX.oracle-->SS)
		QA Docs
		RTM - Requirment Traceability Matrix: Map a reqirement to a test case
			Unit test case document(Dev): ETL package testing carried out on a particular unit of development such as procedure, function, report, ssis package
				Pre-requisites
				1.Report is deployed correctly
				2.Browser is available with required URL and permissions to run
					EX
					Case#|Steps|ExpectedResult|Actual Result|Status|Priority
						1|1.Open report; 2.Click on drop down for report Month|User sees all 12 months with full names|Month Numbers|Failed|2|
			Test Strategy Document(QA): similar to FRD(Functional Requirements)
			Test Plan(QA): Plan for whole application testing
			Test Case Document(QA): More detailed and involveds lot more senarios + Case are for complete software/application

Step2:
	Methodologies: Step by step process to execute an application
		Steps: Requirment Analysis --> System Design --> Implementation --> Testing --> Deployment --> Maintenance
		-Waterfall
			Gather complete REQ (not flexible, time sensitive, Not visibility, cannot add new requirment later)
		-Agile(Parallel)
			Not a specific method. It's a principle , guide lines, or rules
			1. Work is divided into sprints
				short -small ,portion of work developed at a fast pace ( < 4 weeks)
			2. Instead of documentation agles uses user stories(seperate sotries not the whole requirments)
			3. Each sprint prouides usable delivery which improves visibility to users
			4. Because of earlier visibility to user, we can incorporate user feed back
		-Scrum(one kind of Agile)
			Meetings:
				1.Sprint plan(Begining of the sprint,prepare and plan the sprint, set sprint goal and sprint backlog)
				2.Daliy scrum(what did you do yesterday? What will you do today? Are there any obstacles? Every day)
				3.Sprint review(users reviews, demo features, updated backlog)
				4.Restrospective(Do not have user, try to solve and avoid wrongs with team number, identify ways of improving, end of sprint)
				5.Product backlog grooming(Clarify product backlog items in preparation for sprint planning, before sprint planning)
			Rules:
				1,product owner(jia fang)
					Gather user stories related to the project (product backlog)
					-Story points(How many hours will be cost for each stories, if product owner don't know about tech, scrum master or team make this)
					-Assign priority to the tasks
				2.Scrum master
					1.What did you do yesterday
					2. waht is the plan for today
					3. any road blockes
				3.scrum team
		-Spiral
			For every long and complex projects
			Waterfull manytimes
			1.Identification
			2.Design
			3.Construct or Build
			4.Evaluation and Risk Analysis 
				if need to upgrade, go 1
				if do not proceed, stop,abandon
				if complete, stop
